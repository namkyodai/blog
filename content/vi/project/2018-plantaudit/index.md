## The Project
- **Client**: [Maynilad Water Services Inc.](http://www.mayniladwater.com.ph/)
- **Name**: Plant Audit of Various Pump Stations and Reservoirs
- **Theme**: Asset Management

### Objectives
- Visual Inspection and Testing on mechanical assets (e.g. pump, piping, valves) and electrical assets (e.g. GENSETs, transformers, MCC, Motors) using developed set condition states and standards;
- Energy Audit;
- FDAS and WEM studies;
- Determination of optimal 5 years intervention program;
- Life cycle cost analysis and estimation of Return on Investment.


## Responsibilities
- Record inspection and testing data in a centralized relational database system (MySQL);
- Big data analysis and data solutions on 5-10 years operation data to detect trend and reliability of the system;
- Investigation of current design and operational scheme using qualitative reliability analysis (e.g. FMEA);
- Weibull Analysis and Faul Tree Analysis to estimate reliability;
- Development of a Life Cycle Cost model using reliability concept to determine optimal intervention strategies and program;
- Organizing a series of training and technical workshops on reliability study and modelling used in the project.

## Lesson Learned

## Authorship
- Nam led the team and trained the team to use LaTEX system to compile all reports
