abstract: "In many practices of bridge asset management, life cycle costs are estimated by statistical de-terioration prediction models based upon monitoring data collected through inspection activities.  In many applications, it is, however, often the case that the validity of statistical deterioration prediction models is flawed by an inadequate stock of inspection dates. In this paper, a systematic methodology is presented to provide estimates of the deterioration process for bridge managers based upon empirical judgments at early stages by experts, and whereby revisions may be made as new data are obtained through later inspections. More concretely, Bayesian estimation methodology is developed to improve the estimation of Markov transition probability of the multi-stage exponential Markov model by Markov chain Monte Carlo method using Gibbs sampling. The paper concludes with an empirical example,  using the real world monitoring data, to demonstrate the applicability of the model and its Bayesian estimation method in the case of incomplete monitoring data."
