First of all, I must say that this e-ink device looks pretty nice. 10.3 inc is perfect for me as I have tons of books in PDF and I particularly read quite a number of scientific/research papers. I have been looking for a device like this with reasonable cost for a while.

I will provide a full details pretty soon, right after the PSL, the retailer who sell this product on Lazada Philippines, exchange for me a new one as the current one has a defect that forcing the devide to restart or reboot every few minutes when turning on wifi for internet browsing and using Android app. I have been contacting with Onyx book customer team, they did send me the updated firmware and I installed it. However, the problem has not been solved. PSL understands this fact since I reported to them within few days after receiving it and they are kindly accepting me to return it and exchange for a new one. However, due to covid-16, their office in QC is partially closed, only open within a few time window in a week so till now I still have not received the replacement.

Other than this critical issue, i think it is only a random error, the device itself is great.

Kindy bear with me sometimes after I receive a new one and try it again then I will post my review for those who desparately wanna have this note 2.

Thank you!
